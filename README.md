## Want to fork it? Here's how to get started:
<div id="steps-to-fork" align="left">

1. Clone this repo in the desired directory (currently the prod branch is the most up to date).   
2. Run pnpm install to install all the dependencies.  
3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:  

- REACT_APP_OPEN_AI_KEY 
- REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY
- REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY
- REACT_APP_YELP_API_KEY
- REACT_APP_YELP_API_ID
- REACT_APP_CORS_API_KEY

Resources for getting the API keys: (Note: All of these are free or available for a free trial.)
- Open AI: https://community.openai.com/t/how-do-i-get-my-api-key/29343
- Open Weather: https://openweathermap.org/api
- Google: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/get-api-key
- Yelp: https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/fusion-intro
- Cors: https://cors.sh/ (we need this to avoid making a backend)

4. Run pnpm start to start the development server.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This application includes **GitHub Actions** to automate **CI/CD workflows**. The actions are triggered on **push** and **pull requests** to the main branches. You can **disable or customize** these workflows in the `.github/workflows/` folder as needed.  

Make sure to **add your API keys and secrets** in **Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions** to ensure that all workflows run smoothly. The workflows currently include:

- **Linting**: Ensures consistent code style.
- **e2e tests**: Uses Playwright for end-to-end testing.
- **SonarCloud Code Analysis**: Runs static analysis to assess code quality and detect security issues.

  **Full Instructions** https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarcloud-github-action

### Using SonarCloud for Code Analysis

1. **Set up SonarCloud:**
   - Create an account on [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/).
   - Link your GitHub repository and create a SonarCloud project.

2. **Generate a SonarCloud Token:**
   - Go to **My Account > Security > Tokens** in SonarCloud.
   - Generate a new token and **copy** it (you wonâ€™t see it again).

3. **Add the Token to GitHub Secrets:**
   - Go to **Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions** in your GitHub repository.
   - Add a **new secret** named `SONAR_TOKEN` with the value of the token you copied.

4. **Update the YAML Workflow:**
   - Modify the YAML workflow to include your **SonarCloud project key** and **organization**.

OR

Delete this block in the YAML file:

<code>
 SonarCloud_Analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
      - name: Code Scan
        uses: sonarsource/sonarcloud-github-action@v2
        with:
          args: >
            -Dsonar.projectKey=CoreySumma_astrology
            -Dsonar.organization=coreysumma
        env:
            GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
